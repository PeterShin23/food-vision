## A little journal entry
I wanted to make a project to get my feet wet with ML/AI and their practical applications. Although this project doesn't have much ML/AI of its own but rather the application of services that perform them, finding technologies that would be best suited for the project was super informative. In the future, I would love to write my own ML/AI algorithms to solve problems, but this was a fun one to brainstorm and bring to life.

Happy to say that I do actually use this on a weekly basis and I've saved at least $60 per week. Goal achieved, less food wasted, new things learned, what more can you ask for :)
